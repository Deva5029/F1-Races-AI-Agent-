F1 AI Agent

This project is an AI-powered Formula 1 agent built to analyze race data, make predictions, and provide strategic insights. It uses machine learning models to forecast race results, standings, and other performance metrics.

Key Features:
- Predicts driver and constructor standings
- Analyzes historical F1 race data
- Supports multiple prediction metrics (wins, podiums, DNFs)
- Integrates with Google Generative AI for natural language queries

Technologies Used:
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- SQLite for data storage
- Google Generative AI API

How to Run:
1. Install required packages from requirements.txt
2. Set up your Google Generative AI API key
3. Run `main.py` to start the agent

Note:
This project is for educational and experimental use. Prediction accuracy depends on data quality and model limitations.
